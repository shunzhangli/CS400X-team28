# X-Team 28 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
One can volunteer for a task if he wants to.



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We text periodically in the group chat


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We create a detailed email, text or some sort of message that describes (an) explicit problems. /n


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We do one and a half task. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Try your best and don't get frustrated, get motivated!
No memes in communicatation.
