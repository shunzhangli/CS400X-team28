# X-Team 28 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
1.One can volunteer if they have strong desire for certain task  

2.We will randomanly tasks until preferances/weaknesses are identified
then we can asign people to tasks they might not be strognest at, so they can grow as a programmer.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

1.Through the github repository edits, and emails following task completion status.   

2.We text periodically in the group chat

3.comments in both codes and github operations

## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
1.Emails and other coomunication, texting, for assistence when the situation requires.   

2.We create a detailed email, text or some sort of message that describes (an) explicit problems. 

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
1.Setting milestones for each person and then checking up on other people's milestones come these   
faux deadlines will keep a project on track.  

2.We do one and a half task.   
 

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
1.Try your best and don't get frustrated, get motivated!  

2.If you cannot complete your assigned portion before the deadline, or you have conflicts with previous commitments, tell the team! Don't leave the team in the dark about whether or not something will get done or not.  
No memes in communicatation.
